If you are one of the unlucky few who have to work on a TOM this post provides some hints and tips. I hope it will help you survive the experience and even get something useful out of it. Enormous amounts of money and energy go into TOMs so we should get more value out than we put in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/02/we-need-to-talk-about-tom/&quot;&gt;Keep reading on @CIOPortfolio →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Yearnote 4 November 2019 - 27 November 2020</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/11/yearnote-4-november-2019-27-november-2020/"/><updated>2020-11-20T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/11/yearnote-4-november-2019-27-november-2020/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On a year in Cornwall Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/11/yearnote-4-november-2019-27-november-2020/&quot;&gt;Keep reading on @CIOPortfolio →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Refining your backlogs</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/02/refining-your-backlogs/"/><updated>2020-02-05T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/02/refining-your-backlogs/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My previous update on Backlogs provided an introduction to the term.

The general reaction seemed to be quite negative, at least in my filter bubble. Most of the criticisms are probably reasonable but that may be because there are so few examples of sharing successfully at this scale in other countries or sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2018/01/will-shared-services-ever-work/&quot;&gt;Keep reading on @CIOPortfolio →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
