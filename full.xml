They grow this understanding by communicating and observing. In a team of two there is one channel to consider and both people can devote their time and energy to it. Add two more people to the team and the communication burden doesn’t double it leaps much more. There are now 6 channels across the team. Each person is directly linked to three channels but the others still create a mental load (“Bob says that Ann told him this but that seems different to what Ann told me earlier. What’s going on?”).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we keep teams small, say between 5 and 10 people, and let them spend a lot of time together people’s innate or learned skills will work well. Relationships and trust will grow and they will probably be happier and more effective than the same group working alone. A lot of our basic agile working practices take advantage of this. Many of these practices have been developed by trial and error with small teams to take advantage how people naturally work well together. It is often less about bringing in “agile” and more about taking away other unhelpful practices that stop people doing what they are naturally good at. If you can, keeping things to the scale of this kind of team is a great strategy (perhaps, in another episode, we’ll talk about how lots of our problems can be scaled down to this size but, unfortunately, some can’t). If we have teams that are bigger we start to need that adventurer spirit and be ready for some frustration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will have worked with some much bigger teams than this in the past. Some of them worked really well. Some of them were horrible. Your learning machine will have gone to work. You are sure you know the right ingredients to steer your new team down the right path. But it doesn’t work and some of the team won’t even give your ideas a try. Even with just 20 people in a team there are hundreds of channels at work. No one in the team has a complete picture of what was going on. We are like the cells in a bigger organism which takes on a life of its own and behaves in surprising ways. Study cell biology for a long as you like but it won’t explain why some people are vandals, some are poets, and some are both! Anything you think you learned from the successes and failures needs to be treated with some humility. You may not have had to a chance observe the relationships or interactions that actually made the real difference between the great or disappointing teams you were part of. That’s ok. Keep talking and try something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the scale increases the communication burden explodes faster than our ability to address it. You might find cascade style communications worked great in your last department but everyone is complaining about poor communication in your new department. But you know cascades work as you have done it before. In fact, all you know is cascade communications succeeded in those teams where it was effective. Maybe you never noticed some diligent team members who worked behind the scenes to fill in the holes. Perhaps that is the element you need to recreate now but you never had the opportunity to learn about it. That’s ok. Keep talking and try something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust can become a big issue even when everyone in the team has good intentions and is working towards the same goal. Scale prevents us getting a deep understanding of our colleagues. We still try to anticipate people but we can’t do this as reliably as we do in a small team. People in a big team do things which catch us by surprise more often. We are normally so good at this sort of thing it is quite natural to think your expectations are reasonable. It can lead you to unfairly doubt the motives of the other people. Lack of trust increases the burden which can create a vicious cycle. Some teams or collaborations can be destroyed by this. The individuals are striving for the same goal but their collective efforts are undermined by the scale of the team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a really big scale you can hit seemingly bizarre problems. Surely an organisation of 30,000 people or so can work with common policies on things like HR, Finance and Procurement? In fact, isn’t this essential if we want to avoid chaos? In practice, people are finding that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2012/07/how-to-organise-it-on-a-global-scale/&quot;&gt;policies and standards can’t scale indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; and have to be adventurous and find another way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At around 5000 staff the Council is already big enough to hit limits to scale for some things. On top of that we run payroll for around 40,000 people and many of our services have to collaborate with partners and customers beyond this. This is really hard work. We don’t struggle because we are bad at our jobs it is just that our solutions don’t scale as we would like. The things we learnt at one scale don’t apply so well at another. Nothing we can get from anyone else will scale as well as they think it will. Guess what? It’s ok. Keep talking and try something else.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Transforming at Scale - Series Pilot</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/"/><updated>2024-03-16T20:57:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are making changes at Cornwall Council&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; all the time but sometimes we have grander ambitions, as we have for Digital Futures&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We talk about changing things at “scale” and to add more emphasis we sometimes swap out “change” for “transform”. If we are scaling across a period of time we might use a phrase like “repeatable” and if we are scaling across teams or services we sometimes talk about “standards” or “re-use”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans are great at learning how to deal with scaling. Imagine you have a favourite recipe for a meal for four people. If you need to feed eight people you will have some intuition that you will need to double the ingredients but probably not double the cooking time and almost certainly not double the temperature!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is easy to make mistakes when scaling but for some things we experiment and learn very early. When kids make models of things they might want to make a copy that is twice the size or more. Even if they don’t explicitly do the maths they start to learn that the weight of things grows (often cube of the scale) at a faster rate than the strength of the construction (often square of the scale) and you have to make changes to the dimensions or materials to keep things in shape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can afford the time and materials experiments and feedback are a great way to deal with scale. One burnt saucepan or some crumpled card and sticky tape are annoying but teach lessons that pay off over a lifetime. When we are talking about large groups of people or a large organisation like the Council it becomes hard or impossible to justify a real experiment. Opportunities to learn still arise, for instance when a bold initiative succeeds or fails. Unfortunately, the celebrations, or recriminations, obscure a lot of the lessons and the complex circumstances make it hard to distinguish between causes and effect. The relentless learning machines we carry around in our heads still go to work and try to make sense of this but we won’t always learn the right lessons and that can trip us up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The larger the scale and the more transformational the change the less reliable our intuitions become. We increasingly have to wrestle with problems and solutions which don’t scale in the way we expect or don’t work at all when considered at a different scale. Let’s work through some examples&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In working through this my goal isn’t to reveal the insightful answer that everyone else has missed. My personal learning machine isn’t any better than yours. I will have had different experiences to you but they are as fragmented and biased as everyone else’s. A more realistic goal is to encourage us all to be bold and humble when we tackle transformation at scale. Being humble is about acknowledging there is a lot we don’t know for sure and recognising that no one else knows for sure, even if they give the impression that they do. Being bold is about taking the next step even in the face of the uncertainty. This is the adventurer’s spirit. Have safety ropes and spare supplies but take a deep breath and go for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Cornwall Council website&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://democracy.cornwall.gov.uk/documents/s156820/Digital%20Future%20Strategy%20-%20Appendix%201.pdf&quot;&gt;Council strategy for our digital future&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-episode-1-people-and-organisations/&quot;&gt;Scaling across people and organisations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2024/03/transforming-at-scale-series-pilot/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/section&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weeknote 19 - 23 July 2021</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/"/><updated>2021-07-21T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On shared provocations, developing agile leaders and anti-racism policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sharing&quot;&gt;Sharing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-sitemap&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I’ve joined a cross-Government group that is looking at how the public sector designs and uses operating models&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There is general agreement that we could make it easier and cheaper to do this sort of work but we are still working out what sort of intervention would help. Can we just publish examples and guides and let people find them or is something more formal and substantial needed to make any difference? We are starting to experiment with a few ideas. One of the experiments is to share some statements about operating models to help expose what is obvious and agreed and what could be controversial and need more discussions. Here is an early draft:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;notice&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;A business model summarises your organisation’s role and purpose. An operating model summarises how you work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Operating models are multidimensional. You can show aspects of your operating model through diagrams, charts and tables but one view won’t capture the whole thing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Operating models are multidisciplinary and touch people, process, tools, money, external parties etc&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Operating models are dynamic. Structures such as role hierarchies are important but so are relationships, information, stocks and flows of work, movements of people etc&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Just like a map isn’t the territory, operating model documents are simplified views of how you actually operate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Some parts of an operating model can be changed simply and directly (e.g. the reporting line for a role) but many aspects are emergent e.g. pace and productivity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Your organisation has an implicit operating model even if you have never written it down&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Documented operating models can be helpful but the only ones that really count are what actually get implemented&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A target operating model with no feasible path from where you are now is useless. Each step on the path needs to be operable&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All operating models are interim and new things start emerging immediately&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A target operating model can be helpful but you will probably never reach it and, if you did, it will no long meet your needs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can’t tell that the ideas in a documented operating model are valid through document reviews. Modelling and simulation can increase confidence and expose more mistakes but real life is the ultimate test.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve also started to draft a sort of “beginner’s guide” and I hope we can discuss how to share this more widely at our next catch up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;doing&quot;&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-comments-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I’ve been introducing the teams running our finance and workforce systems to our new Delivery Manager and introducing our new Delivery Manager to all the jargon and acronyms we fall into when we talk about these systems. For a few months I’ve been covering both the Delivery Manager and Product Manager roles and not doing either of them especially well. I will gradually get back to focusing on all the Product Management I have been neglecting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-umbrella-beach&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Preparations continued for our talk at Agile on the Beach&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in September. The team from the last event in 2019&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; set the bar pretty high and we are quite a way short of that at the moment. We are refining some stories about our work over the last year or so. Some of them won’t make it into the final talk but they will still be useful for other events and possibly our internal training. We are now shifting our attention to story boarding so we can commission the images and videos we want to include in the presentation. As we get closer to the event it will be rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-chalkboard-teacher&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; This week we ran a training session to introduce a group of managers in Adult Social Care to agile ways of working. The team already had some practical experience of agile from their transformation programme but wanted to learn more so they could use it more widely in their work. We made some minor adaptations to the training we had delivered to some of our IS colleagues last week but I hope to get some feedback to help make it even more relevant to their teams. We tried some different tools and techniques so that we could check the attendees were engaged and getting something useful from the session. These seemed to work well so we will take these back into the next IS course and keep improving. We also collected user stories to help plan some follow up. Some of this can be addressed through more training but we might also blend in coaching and sharing between teams. One of the Council’s learning and development team also attended to observe. It looks like there is some good alignment between our agile introduction and the Council’s leadership development curriculum so we are going to follow up and see how we can reinforce the key learning points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-fist-raised fa-flip-horizontal&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The leadership development programme also came up at this month’s meeting of the Staff Race Equality Forum. We talked about the role that all leaders should have in addressing racism and how to make sure that people from under represented groups got the support they needed to take part and get the benefits of attending. We also continued discussing anti-racism policies. I had previously investigated this area&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but most of the examples I could find just focus on minimal legal compliance. I am hoping we can adopt some of the ideas from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which seem to be more ambitious but also quite practical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/02/we-need-to-talk-about-tom/&quot;&gt;bit more about operating models in a previous blog post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://agileonthebeach.com/&quot;&gt;Agile on the Beach&lt;/a&gt; will be the World’s best agile conference this year and not just because it takes place in Cornwall! &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/bVg1o3sq4yA&quot;&gt;Cornwall’s previous talk&lt;/a&gt; was so good I changed by job! &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/09/weeknote-21-25-september-2020/#carin&quot;&gt;More about anti-racism strategy in a previous weeknote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIPD ideas for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/fundamentals/relations/diversity/anti-racism-strategy&quot;&gt;anti-racism strategies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-19-23-july-2021/#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/section&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weeknote 5 - 16 July 2021</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/"/><updated>2021-07-06T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On visiting an office, audits and virtual training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;moving&quot;&gt;Moving&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-building&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I started working from home full time a week or so before the start of the first official lockdown. Aside from a very short visit to collect some equipment, this week was the first time I have returned to do some work in our office. A large portion of our IS department was based in an area on the ground floor but this has been put to use as bookable team collaboration spaces and the whole office now has a reduced capacity, COVID-safe layout. I’m not sure we will ever return to the way we worked in 2019 but I am sure we will get back to some level of face-to-face working. It will probably be done deliberately for specific purposes rather than the default way of working. We’ve started to experiment with things like the Team Canvas&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so that each of our teams can think about their unique circumstances and agree what will work for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;doing&quot;&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-comments-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; A new engineer has joined our finance and workforce systems team recently so we have started to rebalance the work around the team. As we move people into new areas we need to allocate some time for on-the-job training and pair working, but this is actually a positive benefit as it will increase our resilience and give us more flexibility for covering absences such as annual leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of weeks I have been helping coordinate some of the evidence we need for an external audit. This hasn’t been as easy as it should be, partially due to lack of familiarity. A year or so ago we were running some of our monthly processes for the first time and now it is much more familiar. Recently we completed our first year-end on the new systems and a few of the steps were difficult as they were new. This is the first audit of this kind for these new systems so, in some cases, we need to gather the audit evidence in new ways or clarify what is needed to take account of the fact that we are now using cloud computing services run by a supplier rather than computers running in our own data centre. Next time around will be much easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-clipboard-check&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; A few weeks ago we formed a small group looking at how to improve our testing practices and I joined another catch up with the group this week. Testing is one of those things that everyone knows a little about and it gets more complicated the more you find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people get involved in a bit of testing occasionally, for example, checking that things seem to work just before a big change is going to be made. For other people, testing is their full time job and they will work with teams right at the start to clarify the goals and expected outcomes which will shape what tests will be needed and how they will be done. For occasional testers, finding an error is disappointing and a cause of anxiety. For testing specialists, finding no errors probably means the tests are not good enough and that is a cause of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some teams actually construct tests before they construct the thing they intend to test. Other teams are working with things created by external suppliers which have already been thoroughly tested but, because things can still slip through, they perform even more tests locally for critical elements. There are lots of ways that we can improve and it is great to have a group like this that is passionate about what we should do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-umbrella-beach&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; We are hoping to return to Agile on the Beach&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in September to continue the story that we started to share at the last event in 2019&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I am part of a small group pulling together some stories we can share, which stay true to the spirit of the conference pitch we submitted over a year ago without pretending we haven’t been through a once in a lifetime crisis. I’ve started to sketch out a couple of these stories and it has been really useful to go back over past weekknotes&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as a reminder of what happened and what I felt about it at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-chalkboard-teacher&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Delivering training has been one of the most satisfying parts of my work throughout my career. I was training people in how to write programs&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; within months of starting my first proper job and have been delivering training on and off all my career. It was great to get the chance to run some of our introductory agile training last week and there is more to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have used external training providers with mixed results. A lot of agile training is linked to specific frameworks and recognised certifications and the courses can feel like cramming for an exam rather than building skills and understanding. A lot of generic agile material can feel like common sense. The hard part is applying it in context and dealing with the specific constraints and compromises you have to face. I hope that sharing our trainers’ experience of applying the ideas and techniques in practice in the same environment will turn out to be more valuable than ticking a certification box. Let’s see what the initial trainees share in their feedback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have to admit I found the shift to virtual training really hard. I like to go off script and respond to trainee feedback during a course. Sometimes this can be in response to a question or comment but, in a training room setting, it can often be people’s facial expressions, unconscious sounds and body posture. You will get signals that people are tired, want to move on or are struggling to keep up way before anyone will put it into words. It is electric to experience the wave of nods, smiles and quiet exhalations when a group suddenly understands a difficult or subtle concept. Sometimes, it might take an unscheduled group exercise or on-the-fly rescheduling. Sometimes, it just takes a different visual aid or even just a change of position in the training room. Loads of these signals and responses are muffled in a virtual course. This should have been easy to anticipate but I realised too late that I hadn’t prepared enough for it and hadn’t developed enough virtual alternatives. I’ll do better next time but it will take a lot of research and experimentation to break my old habits and find new ways to train virtually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-laptop-code&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Sorry if you are getting fed up with this but here is my regular reminder that codebar&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fn6&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a group of really great people trying to do some really great things. This month’s session was fun and challenging again. I was helping someone get to grips with the sorts of testing expected in a professional environment. You can get quite a lot done with software without thinking about testing but once you work with something more complex, or as part of a team, then testing quickly becomes an essential skill that you need to master. You often need to be quite knowledgeable and proficient with the programing language to make full use of the testing tools as well but we got there in the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/agile-outside-the-box/the-team-canvas-building-trust-via-transparency-cf88ac05c66d&quot;&gt;Read more about Team Canvas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://agileonthebeach.com/&quot;&gt;Agile on the Beach&lt;/a&gt; will be the World’s best agile conference this year and not just because it takes place in Cornwall! &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/bVg1o3sq4yA&quot;&gt;Cornwall’s previous talk&lt;/a&gt; was so good I changed by job! &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://productforthepeople.xyz/the-why-of-weeknotes-c1cd98967842&quot;&gt;good introduction to the idea of weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a sign of the times, I was teaching people to program in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Ada&lt;/a&gt; as loads of our customers and contracts demanded it but few people will have heard of it now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codebar are always looking for more coaches so &lt;a href=&quot;https://codebar.io/&quot;&gt;find out what is involved&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codebar.io/member/new&quot;&gt;sign up as a coach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/07/weeknote-5-16-july-2021/#fnref6&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/section&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weeknote 28 June - 2 July 2021</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-28-june-2-july-2021/"/><updated>2021-06-30T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-28-june-2-july-2021/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On interim roles, trade-offs and looking outside my “woke” filter bubble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;doing&quot;&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-comments-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; For the last six months or so, I have been spending most of my time working on our finance and workforce systems but the intention was always to get back to my core agile coaching role at some point. We’ve got a full year of experience working with the new systems so we have a pretty good idea of what we need to do to run them effectively. This week we have been putting the finishing touches to some of the new roles we are going to need. Once we have recruited into these roles I will be able to hand over and get back to, what should be, the day job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week we have also been helping the last few people move off our old finance and workforce systems so we can then shut them down and dismantle them. Everyone has been using the new systems for day to day work for over a year but a few people need to access historic information and will occasionally need to do this for years to come. Since the historic data does not change we have created a set of reports to meet the most important needs, such as the records we must keep for tax and other regulatory purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking&quot;&gt;Thinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-balance-scale&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; As we fill out the long term organisation to run our finance and workforce systems we will open up some opportunities but will also have to make some tough trade-offs. We will get the opportunity to pick up more of the items in our roadmap and deliver the benefits they promise but the trade-offs also start with the roadmap items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the roadmap items are good ideas in their own right but we can’t do them all and certainly not at the same time. We could tackle the items with the greatest benefits first but that can crowd out smaller items which, as a collection, may produce more value for the same effort. To find the optimum schedule we need a bit more information about the costs, benefits and risks of the items. Developing that information will take effort but any more work we do on items that are subsequently rejected will be a waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Managing the roadmap itself also involves trade-offs. I would like to see richer information about the expected benefits from the work we are being asked to do but other stakeholders are comfortable with the benefits and want better information about when the work is likely to start and finish. We could do more work on all of this but that involves making estimates which might prove to be unreliable and consumes effort that might be better spent on delivering the most important items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why not just increase capacity so we can cover all of the work? For a variety of reasons, our finances are effectively fixed in the medium-term so increasing capacity in one team means that another team will have to do without. This becomes another trade-off and when the other teams are on the front-line providing essential care services these are not simple trade-offs to make. We can shift how our capacity is allocated within the team. For example, reducing the effort we put into training, quality or contingency measures would boost capacity in the short-term but would store up potentially dangerous problems for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are other trade-offs to make in how we get the work done. For example, when teams collaborate it can help if they have adopted similar approaches such as how they organise, prioritise and plan their work. We could set standards and apply controls to achieve this but these would then become obstacles to teams developing new and better ways of working. Even the structure and scope of the teams themselves is a trade-off between a multitude of alternative ways to organise ourselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be honest, I can’t hold all of this in mind at one point in time so even which challenge to focus on is a trade-off. So far, my focus has been on getting the right capacity in our team. We are not there yet but the next few steps are clear. It is probably the right time to focus on something else. I can see some more roadmap work coming my way!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-exclamation-triangle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I am trying to be a good ally&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-28-june-2-july-2021/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and work against inequality. Part of this work is about being better informed and there are two sides to this. One is to learn more about the experiences of people facing discrimination because of their gender, skin colour, physical abilities or other characteristics. The other side is to learn more about the people who don’t share my views on these topics. Personally, I quite like the idea that someone might think I am “woke” but many people use this as a derogatory term and that probably includes some of my friends and family. I am not a fan of the Daily Mail or GB News but there is no point in me pretending that they aren’t influential and I would just become a different sort of bigot if I dismissed criticisms or challenges to my views out of hand. It isn’t comfortable getting out of my filter bubble&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-28-june-2-july-2021/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and engaging with some of this material but there can be some pleasant surprises on occasions. Anyway, it is a trivial burden compared to the bias and inequality that others have to face on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I write about this I remember an occasion when I fell short of my ideals.

COVID restrictions still make this harder than normal but we are getting better at it as we get more practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;sharing&quot;&gt;Sharing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cornwall Council is unique but parts of what we do and some of our issues have a lot in common with other organisations, especially in the public sector. I am a member of a number of groups which are trying to collaborate on shared challenges so we can make our limited individual efforts go further. I attended meet ups for two of these groups this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-handshake&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; One group is taking a fresh look at how we might share more across councils&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-21-25-june-2021/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, suppliers are often able to offer better prices for larger volumes. If several councils collaborated in purchasing supplies or equipment then they might be able to save money. This is not a new idea and you will always be able to find examples going on but many of us think we are only doing a small portion of what is possible. One of the topics the group looked at this week was funding and governance. The current arrangements for councils aren’t set up to make this sort of sharing easy so the group collected examples of what they had seen work in other sectors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-sitemap&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Another group is looking at how the public sector designs and uses operating models&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-21-25-june-2021/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some of the group are new to the topic and seeking to learn more. Others have a lot of experience but aren’t satisfied with how things are done at the moment. Several of the group fed back on actions they had taken following our previous catch up and we discussed what would be most useful to do as a group. One of the things the group could do is to tackle the jargon and counter some of the common misconceptions. We could also create a beginners guide to help teams that don’t have a lot of direct experience themselves but who are capable of taking the first steps with some good hints and tips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-fist-raised fa-flip-horizontal&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I enjoyed attending the Cornwall Race Equality Forum&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-21-25-june-2021/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; meeting this week although I think it will take me a bit longer to make sense of how the Forum will work. The Forum is comprised of public bodies, charities and interested individuals who share an ambition to increase racial equality across Cornwall. Aligning the efforts of all these participants will, hopefully, increase the impact they can all have but getting such a diverse group to work well together may not be easy as we all have different resources and constraints.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Durant has written &lt;a href=&quot;https://cholten99-61869.medium.com/introducing-the-local-gov-multi-tenant-services-meetup-6b6852e66e12&quot;&gt;a blog post to explain more about these ideas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-21-25-june-2021/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/02/we-need-to-talk-about-tom/&quot;&gt;bit more about operating models in a previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-21-25-june-2021/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://letstalk.cornwall.gov.uk/building-bridges&quot;&gt;The Cornwall Race Equality Forum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/06/weeknote-21-25-june-2021/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/section&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weeknote 24 May - 18 June 2021</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/"/><updated>2021-05-23T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On apprenticeships, testing and some large and small achievements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;doing&quot;&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-comments-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; There has been a lot going on around our finance and workforce systems over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We went live with our latest quarterly release. We had done a lot of testing before the release but a couple of annoying things slipped through. The team did a great job of jumping on these to sort them out but it did create some inconvenience for people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the quarterly release was out of the way we switched attention onto our backlog and managed to clear off some important items. Interestingly, some of the insights we got from fixing the quarterly release issues provided the clues we needed to resolve some longer running issues. So that cloud had a silver lining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We held the final board meeting for the implementation project. It has taken a huge amount of work from the project team to get to this point and is a great achievement. Some of the team have now moved on to other projects and assignments but many are continuing to work with us on running and improving the platform. Governance of this ongoing effort now shifts to our design authority which will officially kick-off next month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;learning&quot;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-user-graduate&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Over the last few weeks I have been learning about apprenticeships and talking to colleagues about how we can make the most of the opportunities apprenticeships create. There were a lot of assumptions I had made which I need to update; in particular, how people can take up apprenticeships part way through their careers and not just at the beginning. This could be a really good way for people to develop the skills we need to run our finance and workforce systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-clipboard-check&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I have been getting an update on leading practices in testing by joining in a working group led by our testing specialists. When I started my career testing was mostly a laborious manual process but, like most things in technology, this can be highly automated to be more effective and productive. To make the most of these opportunities we need to change the way we plan and organise our work and even change the way people think about testing. We are hoping to use one of our projects as a showcase of how powerful these practices can be. It should also make it easier for all of our teams to understand what is needed and start making changes in their areas of work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-hand-holding-heart&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Over the last few weeks I’ve been able to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;join a Codebar&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; event to coach someone hoping to start an IT career&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;show a local charity how to save money on file sharing by using secure tools which are free to non-profits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;talk to one of the leaders working on the Cornwall People Hub&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;attend the latest staff forum for race equality&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;hr class=&quot;footnotes-sep&quot; /&gt; &lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Codebar are always looking for more coaches so &lt;a href=&quot;https://codebar.io/&quot;&gt;find out what is involved&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codebar.io/member/new&quot;&gt;sign up as a coach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ciosgrowthhub.com/peoplehub&quot;&gt;The Cornwall People Hub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2020/09/weeknote-14-18-september-2020/#a-word-about-a-good-caus&quot;&gt;bit more about our race equality forum in a previous note&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-24-may-18-june-2021/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/section&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weeknote 10 - 21 May 2021</title><link href="https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/"/><updated>2021-05-23T00:00:00Z</updated><id>https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On growing our team, cost of delay and a book you must read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;doing&quot;&gt;Doing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-comments-dollar&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The next quarterly release for our finance and workforce systems goes live at the weekend so the last two weeks have been filled with testing.

It can also be uncomfortable talking about costs when people are, quite rightly, more concerned about the impact to our services or the risks to our staff and the people we serve. We are starting to find practical ways to model these non-financial concerns in terms we can use with cost of delay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We need to keep experimenting but, so far, things are going well. In some cases it has helped us identify requests which are of relatively low value and release people to get on with workarounds rather than fruitlessly waiting in the IS queue. We have had other examples where we have been able to create capacity to do the work because we can demonstrate it would be more expensive to wait for our existing capacity to become available. There is other work that falls between these extremes where we can use the cost of delay to schedule work in the most cost effective way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;learning&quot;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-book&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I’ve finally got round to the final chapters of Sooner Safer Happier&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I started enthusing about this before I finished the second chapter. Jonathan Smart will not realise this but he has written a book about how we are approaching agile ways of working at Cornwall Council.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Jonathan, we’ve been inspired by a body of knowledge about agile ways of working but we’ve learnt some hard lessons along the way. We’ll use ideas from frameworks such as Scrum&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and SAFe&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but we won’t follow them dogmatically. Our job is to develop great public services. Using agile ways of working can help us do that but it isn’t an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as the content, I really like the structure which makes it easy to dip back in and re-read parts when the need arises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-fist-raised fa-flip-horizontal&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Over the last two weeks I’ve attended another meeting of our race equality forum&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and coached at another codebar event&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-10-21-may-2021/#fn6&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I’m feeling more comfortable in both of these settings but now I am wondering if that is complacency rather than effectiveness.

Here is a selection of items this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Preparing to interview successful applicants for our new engineering roles.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Attending a review of some unplanned downtime for our recruitment system.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Checking on preparations to test the latest quarterly software update next week.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reviewing software and service contracts which cover these systems.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Making a final decision on the replacement of some specialist software we use to model organisation structures.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Evaluating proposals for automating how we manage annual leave and changes to staff contracts. We are going ahead with one of these right away but the other is going to pause while we make sure the benefits will outweigh the likely costs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Catching up with our other Product Managers to review how we are progressing with our agile transformation and looking at how we can get better at managing our technology architecture and design.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-hands-helping&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I’ve also found or made a little time for some other topics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Attending a really engaging and informative update on our people strategy. The session started with a light-hearted quiz to test our knowledge of key facts and figures about the Council’s workforce.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Introducing one of our Product Managers to some public sector digital communities to make it easier to find and share with others doing similar roles in other councils.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Making plans to try more skill sharing with colleagues at Dorset.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Talking to our Adult Social Care team about one of their experiments with agile ways of working and how we can work together on the next steps.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;admiring&quot;&gt;Admiring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-thumbs-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; The final counting is coming to a close in numerous local elections across the country. My colleagues have put in a load of time and effort to make these elections go smoothly, from staffing polling stations and counting votes to keeping critical systems up and running. There are a load of specialist systems which help us manage elections but this was also a big test of the infrastructure behind our new website. The usual effort has been compounded by COVID restrictions and the implementation of new boundaries&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cioportfolio.github.io/2021/05/weeknote-4-7-may-2021/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Demand for this work constantly shifts as change programmes come and go so supply needs to be flexible too. It is not cost effective to have a large, permanent team waiting for the peaks in demand, nor to use contractors and suppliers for everything, so we are going to use a blended approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks we have been running a recruitment campaign to expand our permanent team a little and should start interviewing next week. In addition we have been looking at how we can fine tune the blended approach. The sorts of things we are exploring are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;what sorts of commercial arrangements would best fit the profile of our work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;how to be clear about what we need without locking out great new ideas from suppliers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;establishing great collaboration and team working with temporary supplier staff&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the skills we need to develop to sustainably work this way.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May we will receive our next quarterly release from our main finance and workforce system. For a few weeks our specialist teams have been getting reading for a short but intensive period of testing. Regular releases means that the amount of change in each release is quite small and so is the potential impact. It is still possible for defects to get through so it is prudent for us to test the parts that are most critical for us. We’ll also review our roadmap of future developments as the release may include things we are not using right now but may want to take on in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;failing&quot;&gt;Failing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-window-close&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I’m covering several roles on a temporary basis at the moment. I knew that I would have to prioritise and drop some things but knowing this, feeling it and doing it are not the same. There are some lower priority things that I have continued and have no regrets. Some of my coaching activities don’t take a large amount of time but they do give me an energy boost which, I hope, makes me more productive and focused when spending time on the priorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve made other choices which I do regret, for example, dropping out of a project which has gone on to face some big challenges. I’ll never know if I could have helped the project to avoid or cope with these but I feel like I should have shared more of the burden. I’m also regretting starting or continuing some initiatives which are only getting half the attention they need. These can start to feel like a drain rather than a boost, especially when I am struggling on one of the higher priority bits of work. The test for me now is to make a decision and either commit and continue these initiatives or drop them until I can work on them properly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;caring&quot;&gt;Caring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa-solid fa-fist-raised fa-flip-horizontal&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I attended another meeting of our staff race equality forum. Every time I learn something new. Sometimes it could be about the impact of something in the news which I have missed. Following the meeting I’ve been thinking about the availability of goods and services tailored to different races and cultures. This part of the world is so prepared to cater for the needs of people like me, I almost never need to think about these things. Shoe size is probably the only category where I don’t count as “normal”. On the rare occasions I get a new pair of shoes it can be exasperating. Struggling to find the basic things you need all the time must be exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
